This paper summarizes the design of bale collector swarming in precision farming. To increase the agricultural yield and to ease the process, rising technology of robotic swarming plays very important role. Swarm of robots can be used in various agriculture applications, from planting the seeds, spraying pesticides, monitoring crop health to harvesting crops.
