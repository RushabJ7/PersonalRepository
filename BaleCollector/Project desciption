The design of bale collector swarming in precision farming. To increase the agricultural yield and to ease the process, rising technology of robotic swarming plays very important role. In this project the system is designed in the such a way that the bale collectors which are of 3 different types(Small,medium,large) predicts which bale it should collect using ML algorithm and moves towards the target to pick it.
